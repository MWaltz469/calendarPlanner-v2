      <h2>100% Vibecoded</h2>

      <p>This entire application was vibecoded on hopes, dreams, and an unreasonable amount of caffeine.</p>

      <p>Not a single line was written by human hands with full certainty of what it does. Every function, every CSS rule, every database query was conjured through the ancient art of describing what you want and trusting the machine to figure it out.</p>

      <p>There was no Figma. There was no sprint planning. There was no QA team. There was just a person, an AI, and an increasingly ambitious TODO list that grew from "fix some bugs" into a full-featured trip coordination platform with an admin portal, real-time collaboration, and a design token system.</p>

      <p>And yet, here we are. It works. Probably.</p>
